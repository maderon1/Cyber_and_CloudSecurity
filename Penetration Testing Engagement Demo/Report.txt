Penetration Testing Engagement
In this engagement, I will play the role of an independent penetration tester hired by GoodCorp Inc. to perform security tests against their CEO’s workstation.

Scenario:  
- The CEO claims to have passwords that are long and complex and therefore unhackable.
- I am tasked with gaining access to the CEO's computer and using a Meterpreter session to search for two files that contain the strings recipe and seceretfile.

Scope:
- The scope of this engagement is limited to the CEO's workstation only. I am not permitted to scan any other IP addresses or exploit anything other than the CEO's IP address.
- The CEO has a busy schedule and cannot have the computer offline for an extended period of time. Therefore, denial of service and brute force attacks are prohibited.
- After you gain access to the CEO’s computer, you may read and access any file, but you cannot delete them. Nor are you allowed to make any configurations changes to the computer.
- Since I have already been provided access to the network, OSINT won't be necessary.
