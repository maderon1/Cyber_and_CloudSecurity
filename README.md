# Cybersecuity_and_CloudSecurity

This repository outlines all the cybersecurity related scripts, diagrams and other documentations that I created. 

The Diagrams folder contains two diagrams--Azure VM Diagram and Network Diagram Sample. I built an Azure Resource Group with all the VMs listed in the Azure diagram. The Network diagram lists a sample of a network that has a firewall, a server, two switches, and six computers.

The ansible folder contains four YAML files.
